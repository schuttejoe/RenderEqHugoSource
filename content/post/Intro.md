My name is Joe Schutte and I've been a graphics and engine programmer in the game industry for a bit over ten years now. I've recently been dedicating a significant amount of my spare time towards reading research papers with a focus on rendering for film as well as writing an offline renderer using what I've read about. This blog will be a medium for me to write about any interesting subject that I encounter and believe might be helpful to share with others.

(edit: 5/26/2018)
I've revamped my website and wanted to make sure I was giving credit to people and technologies that helped with that. The website was generated using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme started as [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal/) but I modified it a bit to suit my needs. You're welcome to make use of my modified version [Medial](https://github.com/schuttejoe/medial-theme).
