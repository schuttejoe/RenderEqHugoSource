description: "After joining up with what started as a very small studio called Sparkypants it might be easier to list the areas of code I didn't work on. This game was developed in our own in-house engine that was forked from my personal codebase, called the ShootyEngine, that was renamed and developed as the Sparkle Engine. As lead render programmer I developed much of the renderer and build system as well as playing a major part in engine and tools development."
